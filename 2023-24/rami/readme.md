Curriculum materials based on RAMI were developed for two separate courses at ITC in the 2023-'24 academic year. 
The first course was called "Forest Monitoring and Carbon Stock Estimation Using Multi-Source Remote Sensing 
in the Context of Climate Change. These materials are located in the folder called "fmcse". 
The scond course was called "Environmental Monitoring and Modelling for Natural Resources Management", and 
are located in the folder called "nrm4". The curriculum materials are largely the same, but the "fmcse" materials 
focus on a study area in the Peruvian Amazon, whereas the nrm4 materials focus on a study area in Southwestern Ghana.
